<p> Well that was my professional background. Personally I am quite  guy.Actually I love to chat with my friends on diverse topics. I hail from Maharastra, India. I did my basic education 
and engineering from Amravati University. To be frank I was not a technical student rather medical one, but with designed patterned I entered into computer engineering degree program.
After my bachelor degree I worked for a some time, then I decided to go for MS program in USA, then journey started in USA. 
I feel engineering is vast field and you can not be a perfect in that. So I am trying to keep my efforts intact to understand and implement the things wherever I find my interest and passion.
I would love to keep optimism alive within me and be surrounded by optimistic personas.</p>
